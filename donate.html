Thank you for considering donating! Your support will help bring the best music, dance, and theater to Harmonie Hall along with educational programs and workshops. 
It helps us pay artists while offering affordable (sliding-scale or pay-what-you-will) tickets to our community. 
Donations are also needed to maintain the 130-year old space and update sound equipment.
<p>
Harmonie Hall is a fiscally sponsored project of the arts non-profit Fractured Atlas, so <b>your donation to Harmonie Hall is tax-deductible*</b>! If you like what we're about and want to see the live arts thrive, please consider a one-time or monthly donation.

Thank you! Your support means so much!
