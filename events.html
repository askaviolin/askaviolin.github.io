	<span class="title">Covenhoven</span>
	<br>
	<span class="date">September 23, 2023 | 8pm | $20 Suggested | <a href="https://covenhoven.com/house-concert-rsvp">RSVP</a></span>
<br>
<span class="about">Covenhoven is nationally recognized indie artist Joel Van Horne, a multi-instrumental singer-songwriter whose rich harmonies, reedy baritone and commanding falsetto have found a home with critics and fans since 2013. 
<p>Through 4 full length albums and 2 EPs Covenhoven has forged a signature style; layered acoustic arrangements that roll with momentum into orchestral peaks, accompanied by lyrics that contrast hard-won wisdom with the inherent hope of the natural world—from Big Sur to his native Colorado.<p>Covenhoven’s latest album, IV (released in October 2021), is his most collaborative and rock forward to date—taking a producing partner in Ben Wysocki of the Fray, who also performs on the album. IV features over a dozen musicians including Grammy nominated singer-songwriter Gregory Alan Isakov, Luke Mossman of Nathaniel Rateliff & the Night Sweats, and Bluebook’s Julie Davis. <p>Covenhoven’s live performances capture the spirit of his recordings—whether its conjuring cascading loops in his solo shows or backed by a full band—Covenhoven’s sound fills the breadth of outdoor spaces, auditoriums and club stages.</span>
