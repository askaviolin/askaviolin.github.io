	<br>
	<span class="date">Thu Apr 4, 2024 // 8pm // Doors at 7:30 // Suggested $20 <br>
	<br><br>
	<span class="about"><bold>Brittany Ann Tranbaugh</bold> (pronounced TRAN-baw) is a Philadelphia-based songwriter whose queer Americana heartbreaker “Kiss You” won Song of the Year in the 2021 John Lennon Songwriting Contest. Tranbaugh has been writing songs and playing shows as a side gig since she was a teenager, but in February 2023, at 31 years old, she finally quit her office job to pursue a full-time career in music. Her newest release is a self-titled EP produced by Grammy-winner Tyler Chester which showcases Tranbaugh in her new era: energetic, self-assured, surrounded by her beloved musical community, and more commanding as a vocalist and writer than ever before. <p>With vocal stylings reminiscent of jazz classics, <bold>Blair Borax</bold> delivers a unique blend of unapologetic songwriting that fearlessly tackles the taboo and irresistibly catchy pop melodies that stay with you for days. She conjures a vocal charm somewhere in between Regina Spektor and Cat Clyde, wordsmithing inspired by folk songwriting greats like John Prine and Paul Simon, and tender timely vulnerability akin to Haley Heynderickx and Big Thief’s Adrienne Lenker.</span>

	<br>
	<span class="date">June 22 // 8pm (doors at 7:30pm)</span>
	<br>
	<span class="about">About Haley Heyndrickx<br>

<p>It takes a mix of skill and luck to tend a garden well, but it’s impossible without a certain amount of kindness tended. While the cyclical nature of gardening seems inherent, in some ways, Heynderickx is just beginning. Her debut album, named I Need to Start a Garden out of a search for calm through these waves of uncertainty and upheaval, is out now via Mama Bird Recording Co.
<p>For the empathetic singer/songwriter, the reasons for seeking such acceptance and understanding stem from a life of paradoxes. Heynderickx grew up in a religious household in Oregon, closely identifying with her Filipino roots, but also straddling multiple cultural identities. Now residing in Portland, her faith is not overt, but her introspection and continued struggle for self-actualization are easily accessible and relatable.
<p>Likewise, the tracks on I Need to Start a Garden reflect these seemingly disparate elements. Through soft acoustic guitar picking and deftly accented trombone sighs, Heynderickx’s music immediately recalls folk music of the '60s and '70s mixed with a love of jazz radio. But Heynderickx’s singing—her vocals that range from sultry to operatic—belie a tenacity in her soul.
<p>It’s a balance then, between exposing and protecting herself on I Need to Start a Garden. Heynderickx vacillates between powerlessness (opener “No Face”) and empowerment (lead single "Oom Sha La La"). But her generosity of spirit remains the constant throughout the whole album.
<p>You can hear that exceptional care in “Jo”, as she whispers, “You tended your garden like heaven and hell / and you built the birds houses to see if it helped at all.” Aware of the birds, the garden, and anyone listening acutely, Heynderickx’s music serves as an invitation for all to join her. Because the beauty of a garden is that, while it’s often started for deeply personal reasons, its bounty is best consumed and shared with others.

<p>I Need to Start a Garden was produced, engineered and mixed by Zak Kimball at Nomah Studios in Portland, Oregon. Haley Heynderickx co-produced the album. It was mastered by Timothy Stollenwerk at Stereophonic Mastering in Portland. The record features Lily Breshears (Bass, Keys, Backing Vocals), Denzel Mendoza (Trombone, Backing Vocals), Phillip Rogers (Drums, Percussion, Backing Vocals) and Tim Sweeney (Upright Bass).

	<span class="title">Gaia Raga, ft Karsyn and Jane</a> </span>
	<br>
	<span class="date">Feb 25, 2024 // 6:30 // arrival at 6pm</span>
	<br>
	<span class="about">
Gaia Raga is an orchestra, a universe. The sound is multi-instrumental and intuitive, borrowing elements from folk, jazz and Indian classical music. Their original music has a sometimes timeless, ancient feeling, borrowing themes from poets and artists through the ages (lots of Rumi!).

<p>Their songs are threaded with twin-voiced harmonies, through Niki Arrowsmith and Karsyn Wagner on vocals. Andy Dreamos and Chris Smith share percussion, with Andy also doing triple duty on sitar and saxophone. Matthew Trice handles bass, and sometimes, the other saxophone. And RJ Testa brings a certain bluegrass flavor with his mandolin.

<p>Karsyn Wagner is a magical songstress passionate about social justice and the ecology of all life --- she is a part of Gaia Raga and will be enchanting us with a few original solo pieces as a pre-cursor to the full band. 

<p>And to jumpstart the evening as a collective, we have Jane Wadsworth opening up the evening with a song circle. Jane is a catcher of songs  inspired by the lessons we can learn from nature and from our interconnectedness to all life forms on planet earth. They are excited to come together in community to create a circle singing experience that will be colored by the these themes -- and hope you will join them with an open heart and joyful spirit! No singing experience needed <3

<p>ROUGH SCHEDULE

<p>6pm arrival, open Jaya Kava bar offering vegan, organic food and drink, herbal elixirs, mocktails, and hand-squeezed kava tea to #getloosewithoutthebooze. 

<p>6:30pm - song circle led by Jane

<p>7:30pm - opening set by Karsyn

	<span class="title"><a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/745684842437?aff=oddtdtcreator">Driftwood Soldier and Olivia Ellen Lloyd</a> </span>
	<br>
	<span class="date">Sat, Dec 9, 2023 // Doors at 7pm // Music at 8pm // $20 Suggested</span>
	<br>
	<span class="about">Driftwood Soldier isn't your average mandolin-bass foot-stomping gutter-folk duo. Growling and crooning, muttering about lost love, brimstone, and the glorious view from the underside of a rusty world order, Owen holds the rhythm on mandolin and foot percussion. To his left, Bobby stretches bass notes into lyrical vines that vibrate somewhere north of your liver and flower unexpectedly at night. This is the kind of roots music that grows through the cracks in a West Philly sidewalk and drinks its rainwater laced with motor oil.<p>
Their second full-length album, Stay Ahead of the Wolf, arrived late in 2019. It was produced with Erin McKeown and mixed by Grammy winner Ted Hutt. Unfazed by a world in disarray, Stay Ahead of the Wolf crawled up onto its four legs and went barrelling through the digital ether, carrying with it this strange beast’s howl.<p>
Olivia Ellen Lloyd<p>
After releasing her debut album Loose Cannon in February 2021, Olivia Ellen Lloyd has been on a steady diet of writing, touring and honing her bandleading chops at every honky tonk from Nashville to New York. <p>
And it appears that hard work is paying off - her self-funded and independently released debut album Loose Cannon has been quietly winding its way into the hearts and minds of Country and Americana music lovers all over the world. Currently sitting pretty at over 1 million streams on Apple Music and Spotify,  Loose Cannon was featured on numerous best-of lists (Ear to the Ground notably named it their Album of the Year), received praise from Nashville Lifestyles, Rolling Stone Country, Holler Country,  and The Bluegrass Situation, and made it onto editorial playlists on Apple Music, Tidal, and Amazon Music. Her 2020 single “Shepherdstown'“ was named one of Tidal’s best songs of 2020 on their Rising Folk playlist. <p>
She was a 2021 NewSong Music Finalist, earning a slot in the top 3 , which won her a free vinyl pressing of Loose Cannon, and was recently named a 2023 Kerrville Newfolk Winner at the legendary Kerrville Folk Festival. <p>
Her 2022 release of a duo of Hazel Dickens songs received attention from Bluegrass Today, the Bluegrass Situation, and made Spotify’s GrassRoots  and Women of Bluegrass editorial playlists. Her sophomore album is currently in production, produced once again by her dear friend and creative collaborator, Mike Robinson.<p>
Lloyd is a West Virginia native and proud of it. Raised by a musician and a public school educator in Shepherdstown, West Virginia, her sound is a combination of her deeply rooted past and her fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants present. She's continuing to mine that divide as she tours the country full time in her 2010 Toyota Sienna. </span>

	<br>
	<span class="about">Peter Stampfel, a luminary from the iconic psychedelic folk group The Holy Modal Rounders, will play two captivating sets that promise to be a melodious journey through time and space. Since the early 60’s, Peter has written genre-defying songs that encompass traditional folk and experimental music, with whimsical, thought-provoking lyrics. In addition to originals, his 6-person band (including his daughter, Zoe) will play semi-improvised tunes he lovingly calls "soul jingles,” and pre-rock pop songs from the early 20th century, reviving endangered songs teetering on the edge of obscurity. Music Critic Robert Christgau has asserted that “next to Bob Dylan, Stampfel is the closest thing to a genius" to come out of the New York folk revival scene of the 1960's. 
<p>We'll start the night with a set from Philly dream-folk band Song People.</span>

	<span class="date">October 26, 2023 // 7pm/doors at 6pm // Suggested donation $15-25 // RSVP to harmoniehallmail@gmail.com </span>
	<br>
	<span class="about"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieTX18rEHBc">Kendra McKinley</a> is a singer-songwriter whose music bursts with vibrance, sensuality and wit. Her lush blend of chamber pop, jazz, and soul draws from a deep well of inspiration. Whether she’s performing solo or dancing with her live band Kendra’s confident, honeyed voice indulges all who hear it. <p>
 Philadelphia-based <a href="https://linktr.ee/daniandjoe">Dani & Joe</a> are songwriting sweethearts who, after years as supporting members in other prominent Philly bands, hit the scene under their own names in 2021 with the release of 'All for You.' Their beginnings grew out of small intimate shows and the music carries that tradition compositionally. Joni-style folk collage storytelling meets experimental R&B with a Black Keys makeup. </span>

<br>
<span class="about">Covenhoven is nationally recognized indie artist Joel Van Horne, a multi-instrumental singer-songwriter whose rich harmonies, reedy baritone and commanding falsetto have found a home with critics and fans since 2013. 
<p>Through 4 full length albums and 2 EPs Covenhoven has forged a signature style; layered acoustic arrangements that roll with momentum into orchestral peaks, accompanied by lyrics that contrast hard-won wisdom with the inherent hope of the natural world—from Big Sur to his native Colorado.<p>Covenhoven’s latest album, IV (released in October 2021), is his most collaborative and rock forward to date—taking a producing partner in Ben Wysocki of the Fray, who also performs on the album. IV features over a dozen musicians including Grammy nominated singer-songwriter Gregory Alan Isakov, Luke Mossman of Nathaniel Rateliff & the Night Sweats, and Bluebook’s Julie Davis. <p>Covenhoven’s live performances capture the spirit of his recordings—whether its conjuring cascading loops in his solo shows or backed by a full band—Covenhoven’s sound fills the breadth of outdoor spaces, auditoriums and club stages.</span>
