We'll have music by Camp Saint Helene (Catskill, NY) and two local acts - Donnie CoCo and Erik Kramer Philharmonic
<p>
For <strong>Camp Saint Helene</strong>  (<a href="http://www.campsainthelene.com/">website</a> | <a href="https://www.instagram.com/campsainthelene/">Instagram</a> | <a href="https://campsainthelene.bandcamp.com/">Bandcamp</a> | <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/1vpfRUhCqIsLTZyGVf5Gkr?si=W66dlpFSS6iH2e8VGjZgVg">Spotify</a>), the concept of otherworldliness is neither strange nor complex, but alluring and holy. Created by Elizabeth Celeste Ibarra, Dylan Nowik, Wesley Harper and Alex P. Wernquest, they approach their craft akin to a ritual, leaning into the notion that art and expression are sacred experiences on an overstimulated planet. Often informed by the spirit of a defunct Christian-summer camp turned arts-colony deep within the mountains of New York, their music searches for shimmers of hope amidst hints of doom.
</p>
<p>“Farfisa Song”, off their debut record, Mother (2019), was named KEXP’s Song of the Day and added to KEXP Music that Matters Vol. 683 by Cheryl Waters. She describes Camp Saint Helene as “..call[ing] to mind the '60s California folk scene with their gentle, waltz-like pastoral sound”. Additionally, “Farfisa Song” was featured predominantly both in Amazon Prime’s teen horror drama, “I Know What You Did Last Summer” (2022) and Zoe Lister-Jones’ series SLIP on The Roku Channel (2023). Mother was named by Bandcamp as a New and Notable record of 2019, describing it as “Occult-folk in the 70’s U.K. tradition that further affirms the link between Appalachian and British folk songs”.</p>
<p>
In 2023, they were commissioned by NADA x Foreland to present a live performance and installation piece titled “Into the Garden” for Upstate Art Weekend in Catskill, NY.
They recorded their first album almost entirely live to 8-track, ½” tape, at Basement Floods Records in Catskill, New York. Their second album is currently in production.</p>
<p><strong>Erik Kramer</strong> is a multi-instrumentalist, songwriter, and producer best known for his bass playing as a sideman in a plethora of local and touring acts. His ever rotating ensemble features many of Philadelphia's most exciting instrumentalists and songwriters and weaves together psychedelia, rock, funk, folk, and everywhere in between through the improvisational lense of a jazz combo. He put out his debut record "Missed the Boat" in 2017 and will be putting out the follow up in 2024. This show will feature the Erik Kramer Philharmonic which will be a 10 piece psychedelic acoustic ensemble full of horns, strings, vocal harmonies, and intriguing arrangements.</p>

	<div class="about">Ágról ágra is a program of traditional Hungarian folk music, and compositions by Béla Bartók for unaccompanied female voices. Ágról ágra features new arrangements of the traditional songs by Marisa Michelson, Sara Serpa, Guillermo Klein, and Jeon Song Yi. Kinga Cserjési leads this exploration into the music of her native country 
	<p> Tanjo & Crow is a no-holds-barred exploration of roots music through eclectic songwriting, Appalachian arrangements, and seemingly fearless improvisation.

	<div class="about">Jon Langford's been in more bands than you have digits - and that's true even if you were born with a few extras! From his early days in Mekons, Delta 5, Three Johns and even Sisters Of Mercy (booted for not wearing black) to a veritable explosion of one-off recordings and performances with more names than we could ever hope to list in full. A Wikipedia description for this group, The Bright Shiners (described therein as 'circa 2022 through at least 2023, in Northern California') provides some sense of the complex taxonomy needed just to keep track of Jon's massive oeuvre.

<p>Happily, that's an understated description of a serious new outlet for his endless creativity, and The Bright Shiners' recording activities have produced a full album, Where It Really Starts, the first recording in a collaboration with Tamineh Gueramy, Alice Spencer, and Jon's frequent musical partner, John Szymanski.

<p>Jon Langford & the Bright Shiners will tour mercilessly throughout 2024.</div>

		<span class="date">8pm-9:30pm | Doors 7pm | $25 | BYOB <br> <a href="https://undertowshows.com/products/philadelphia-pa-june-20">TICKETS</a></span>
		</div>
	<div class="about">Laura Gibson is an internationally acclaimed multi-instrumentalist, singer-songwriter and producer, born and raised in the small Oregon logging town of Coquille. Her most recent album Goners (Barsuk/City Slang) is a meditation on grief and empathy which The Fader described as, "so incessantly beautiful that one cannot help but want to gently crack it open to get to its beating core.” The New York Times summarized its themes: “longing and instinct, and whether they can ever converge.” 
 
<p>Both literary and raw, with a love of traditional folk music and a bent toward experimentation, Gibson has toured four continents and had the distinct honor of performing the very first NPR Tiny Desk Concert. Between albums, Gibson earned an MFA in fiction writing from Hunter College, completing her thesis in the back of a tour van. She's been awarded residencies at Yaddo, Ucross, and AIRIE Everglades; is the recipient of a Hertog fellowship and a RACC Grant; and remains a frequent collaborator with both major arts organizations and her indie rock peers.</div>

		<span class="title">Haley Heynderickx</span>
		<br>
		<span class="date">8pm | Doors 7:30 | $30 | BYOB <br> <a href="https://buytickets.at/harmoniehall/1207008">TICKETS</a></span>
		</div>
	<div class="about"><p>It takes a mix of skill and luck to tend a garden well, but it’s impossible without a certain amount of kindness tended. While the cyclical nature of gardening seems inherent, in some ways, Heynderickx is just beginning. Her debut album, named I Need to Start a Garden out of a search for calm through these waves of uncertainty and upheaval, is out now via Mama Bird Recording Co.
<p>For the empathetic singer/songwriter, the reasons for seeking such acceptance and understanding stem from a life of paradoxes. Heynderickx grew up in a religious household in Oregon, closely identifying with her Filipino roots, but also straddling multiple cultural identities. Now residing in Portland, her faith is not overt, but her introspection and continued struggle for self-actualization are easily accessible and relatable.
<p>Likewise, the tracks on I Need to Start a Garden reflect these seemingly disparate elements. Through soft acoustic guitar picking and deftly accented trombone sighs, Heynderickx’s music immediately recalls folk music of the '60s and '70s mixed with a love of jazz radio. But Heynderickx’s singing—her vocals that range from sultry to operatic—belie a tenacity in her soul.
<p>It’s a balance then, between exposing and protecting herself on I Need to Start a Garden. Heynderickx vacillates between powerlessness (opener “No Face”) and empowerment (lead single "Oom Sha La La"). But her generosity of spirit remains the constant throughout the whole album.
<p>You can hear that exceptional care in “Jo”, as she whispers, “You tended your garden like heaven and hell / and you built the birds houses to see if it helped at all.” Aware of the birds, the garden, and anyone listening acutely, Heynderickx’s music serves as an invitation for all to join her. Because the beauty of a garden is that, while it’s often started for deeply personal reasons, its bounty is best consumed and shared with others.

<p>I Need to Start a Garden was produced, engineered and mixed by Zak Kimball at Nomah Studios in Portland, Oregon. Haley Heynderickx co-produced the album. It was mastered by Timothy Stollenwerk at Stereophonic Mastering in Portland. The record features Lily Breshears (Bass, Keys, Backing Vocals), Denzel Mendoza (Trombone, Backing Vocals), Phillip Rogers (Drums, Percussion, Backing Vocals) and Tim Sweeney (Upright Bass).

	<div class="about">Windborne’s captivating show draws on the singers’ deep roots in traditions of vocal harmony, while the absolute uniqueness of their artistic approach brings old songs into the present. Known for the innovation of their arrangements, their harmonies are bold and anything but predictable. Instead of simply dazzling the audience with vocal fireworks; Windborne evokes a deep emotional response connecting their audience to the past, distant places and themselves, it's no wonder they have been crowd favorites since starting to tour in 2018.</div>

	<br>
	<span class="date">Thu Apr 4, 2024 | 8pm | Doors at 7:30 | Suggested $20 <br>
	<br><br>
	<span class="about"><bold>Brittany Ann Tranbaugh</bold> (pronounced TRAN-baw) is a Philadelphia-based songwriter whose queer Americana heartbreaker “Kiss You” won Song of the Year in the 2021 John Lennon Songwriting Contest. Tranbaugh has been writing songs and playing shows as a side gig since she was a teenager, but in February 2023, at 31 years old, she finally quit her office job to pursue a full-time career in music. Her newest release is a self-titled EP produced by Grammy-winner Tyler Chester which showcases Tranbaugh in her new era: energetic, self-assured, surrounded by her beloved musical community, and more commanding as a vocalist and writer than ever before. <p>With vocal stylings reminiscent of jazz classics, <bold>Blair Borax</bold> delivers a unique blend of unapologetic songwriting that fearlessly tackles the taboo and irresistibly catchy pop melodies that stay with you for days. She conjures a vocal charm somewhere in between Regina Spektor and Cat Clyde, wordsmithing inspired by folk songwriting greats like John Prine and Paul Simon, and tender timely vulnerability akin to Haley Heynderickx and Big Thief’s Adrienne Lenker.</span>

	<span class="title">Gaia Raga, ft Karsyn and Jane</a> </span>
	<br>
	<span class="date">Feb 25, 2024 | 6:30 | arrival at 6pm</span>
	<br>
	<span class="about">
Gaia Raga is an orchestra, a universe. The sound is multi-instrumental and intuitive, borrowing elements from folk, jazz and Indian classical music. Their original music has a sometimes timeless, ancient feeling, borrowing themes from poets and artists through the ages (lots of Rumi!).

<p>Their songs are threaded with twin-voiced harmonies, through Niki Arrowsmith and Karsyn Wagner on vocals. Andy Dreamos and Chris Smith share percussion, with Andy also doing triple duty on sitar and saxophone. Matthew Trice handles bass, and sometimes, the other saxophone. And RJ Testa brings a certain bluegrass flavor with his mandolin.

<p>Karsyn Wagner is a magical songstress passionate about social justice and the ecology of all life --- she is a part of Gaia Raga and will be enchanting us with a few original solo pieces as a pre-cursor to the full band. 

<p>And to jumpstart the evening as a collective, we have Jane Wadsworth opening up the evening with a song circle. Jane is a catcher of songs  inspired by the lessons we can learn from nature and from our interconnectedness to all life forms on planet earth. They are excited to come together in community to create a circle singing experience that will be colored by the these themes -- and hope you will join them with an open heart and joyful spirit! No singing experience needed <3

<p>ROUGH SCHEDULE

<p>6pm arrival, open Jaya Kava bar offering vegan, organic food and drink, herbal elixirs, mocktails, and hand-squeezed kava tea to #getloosewithoutthebooze. 

<p>6:30pm - song circle led by Jane

	<br>
	<span class="date">Sat, Dec 9, 2023 | Doors at 7pm | Music at 8pm | $20 Suggested</span>
	<br>
	<span class="about">Driftwood Soldier isn't your average mandolin-bass foot-stomping gutter-folk duo. Growling and crooning, muttering about lost love, brimstone, and the glorious view from the underside of a rusty world order, Owen holds the rhythm on mandolin and foot percussion. To his left, Bobby stretches bass notes into lyrical vines that vibrate somewhere north of your liver and flower unexpectedly at night. This is the kind of roots music that grows through the cracks in a West Philly sidewalk and drinks its rainwater laced with motor oil.<p>
Their second full-length album, Stay Ahead of the Wolf, arrived late in 2019. It was produced with Erin McKeown and mixed by Grammy winner Ted Hutt. Unfazed by a world in disarray, Stay Ahead of the Wolf crawled up onto its four legs and went barrelling through the digital ether, carrying with it this strange beast’s howl.<p>
Olivia Ellen Lloyd<p>
After releasing her debut album Loose Cannon in February 2021, Olivia Ellen Lloyd has been on a steady diet of writing, touring and honing her bandleading chops at every honky tonk from Nashville to New York. <p>
And it appears that hard work is paying off - her self-funded and independently released debut album Loose Cannon has been quietly winding its way into the hearts and minds of Country and Americana music lovers all over the world. Currently sitting pretty at over 1 million streams on Apple Music and Spotify,  Loose Cannon was featured on numerous best-of lists (Ear to the Ground notably named it their Album of the Year), received praise from Nashville Lifestyles, Rolling Stone Country, Holler Country,  and The Bluegrass Situation, and made it onto editorial playlists on Apple Music, Tidal, and Amazon Music. Her 2020 single “Shepherdstown'“ was named one of Tidal’s best songs of 2020 on their Rising Folk playlist. <p>
She was a 2021 NewSong Music Finalist, earning a slot in the top 3 , which won her a free vinyl pressing of Loose Cannon, and was recently named a 2023 Kerrville Newfolk Winner at the legendary Kerrville Folk Festival. <p>
Her 2022 release of a duo of Hazel Dickens songs received attention from Bluegrass Today, the Bluegrass Situation, and made Spotify’s GrassRoots  and Women of Bluegrass editorial playlists. Her sophomore album is currently in production, produced once again by her dear friend and creative collaborator, Mike Robinson.<p>
Lloyd is a West Virginia native and proud of it. Raised by a musician and a public school educator in Shepherdstown, West Virginia, her sound is a combination of her deeply rooted past and her fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants present. She's continuing to mine that divide as she tours the country full time in her 2010 Toyota Sienna. </span>

	<br>
	<span class="about">Peter Stampfel, a luminary from the iconic psychedelic folk group The Holy Modal Rounders, will play two captivating sets that promise to be a melodious journey through time and space. Since the early 60’s, Peter has written genre-defying songs that encompass traditional folk and experimental music, with whimsical, thought-provoking lyrics. In addition to originals, his 6-person band (including his daughter, Zoe) will play semi-improvised tunes he lovingly calls "soul jingles,” and pre-rock pop songs from the early 20th century, reviving endangered songs teetering on the edge of obscurity. Music Critic Robert Christgau has asserted that “next to Bob Dylan, Stampfel is the closest thing to a genius" to come out of the New York folk revival scene of the 1960's. 
<p>We'll start the night with a set from Philly dream-folk band Song People.</span>

	<br>
	<span class="about"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieTX18rEHBc">Kendra McKinley</a> is a singer-songwriter whose music bursts with vibrance, sensuality and wit.

 Philadelphia-based <a href="https://linktr.ee/daniandjoe">Dani & Joe</a> are songwriting sweethearts who, after years as supporting members in other prominent Philly bands, hit the scene under their own names in 2021 with the release of 'All for You.' Their beginnings grew out of small intimate shows and the music carries that tradition compositionally. Joni-style folk collage storytelling meets experimental R&B with a Black Keys makeup. </span>

<span class="about">Covenhoven is nationally recognized indie artist Joel Van Horne, a multi-instrumental singer-songwriter whose rich harmonies, reedy baritone and commanding falsetto have found a home with critics and fans since 2013. 
<p>Through 4 full length albums and 2 EPs Covenhoven has forged a signature style; layered acoustic arrangements that roll with momentum into orchestral peaks, accompanied by lyrics that contrast hard-won wisdom with the inherent hope of the natural world—from Big Sur to his native Colorado.<p>Covenhoven’s latest album, IV (released in October 2021), is his most collaborative and rock forward to date—taking a producing partner in Ben Wysocki of the Fray, who also performs on the album. IV features over a dozen musicians including Grammy nominated singer-songwriter Gregory Alan Isakov, Luke Mossman of Nathaniel Rateliff & the Night Sweats, and Bluebook’s Julie Davis. <p>Covenhoven’s live performances capture the spirit of his recordings—whether its conjuring cascading loops in his solo shows or backed by a full band—Covenhoven’s sound fills the breadth of outdoor spaces, auditoriums and club stages.</span>

Everyone will have the opportunity to create a booklet as a collection of the prints made to take with them. Tickets for this event are $20. As always, no one will be turned away for lack of funds- feel free to email us at harmoniehallmail@gmail.com for a ticket price reduction. Tickets will be available at the door, but advance is preferred so we can be sure to have enough materials for all folks attending!
